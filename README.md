# django_project

Passing Python Django course by Corey Schafer on YouTube.
It is really good one, since its author goes in-depth, step-by-step, explaining details and how everything works under the hood.
This series helped me a lot while I was studying Python courses in university, and now I wanted to rewatch it and reach to the end, since I didn't before.
